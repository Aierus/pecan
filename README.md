# Pecan
Pecan is a bar for macOS.  It was built to be highly configurable and — by default — reports the current ChunkWM workspace, network bandwidth, date, battery percentage and time.

Because Pecan is styled using CSS3 variables, the top lines of style.css can easily be editted to change properties like opacity, alignment, padding, colors and more.

Pecan is also capable of using system colorschemes generated by Dylan Arap's [Wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Instructions

Pecan has the following dependencies: Übersicht, Ifstat and [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm).

Übersicht can be found [here](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

To install Ifstat via Homebrew:

```
brew install ifstat
```

And to install [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm):

```
brew tap crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm
brew install chunkwm
````

Now that the dependencies are installed you can clone this repository to where your Übersicht bars are placed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/Pecan.git $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/
```

If Übersicht is running, then the bar should be running!  To customize to your liking, you can edit the top lines of the included stylesheet.

```
nvim $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/style.css
```
