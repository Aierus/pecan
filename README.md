# Pecan
Pecan is a bar for macOS.  It was built to be highly configurable and — by default — reports the current workspace, network bandwidth, date, battery percentage and time.

Pecan is also capable of using system colorschemes generated by Dylan Arap's [Wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Instructions

Pecan has the following dependencies: Übersicht, Ifstat and [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) (optional.)

#### Übersicht
Übersicht can be found [here](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

Once Übersicht is installed, you can clone this repository to where your Übersicht bars are placed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/Pecan.git $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/
```

If Übersicht is running, then the bar should be running!

## Optional features

#### Network bandwidth
Current download and upload speeds may be shown in the 2nd-to-left element via Ifstat.  If Ifstat is not found, then the current wifi network will be displayed instead.  To install Ifstat via Homebrew:

```
brew install ifstat
```

#### Workspaces
Current workspace ID can be shown on the left element if ChunkWM is installed, otherwise an Apple symbol will be shown instead.  To install [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm):

```
brew tap crisidev/homebrew-chunkwm
brew install chunkwm
````

## Customization
Because Pecan is styled using CSS3 variables, the top lines of `style.css` can easily be editted to change properties like opacity, alignment, padding, colors and more.
